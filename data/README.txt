Elk Data
===============
Elk data from SSM detailed in Appendix S1 of Tallian et al. 2017 (Func. Ecol.)
  -- Manuscript: https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12866

SSM re-run by BJS for 1923 -- 2022

===============
Bison Data
===============
Bison data estimated from Mosley & Mundinger 2018 (Rangelands)
This paper has northern range specific estimates for 1978 -- 2018
  -- Manuscript: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rala.2018.10.006

Data estimated from Fig. 1 and saved as NR_bison_estimated.csv

===============
Wolf Data
===============
Data compiled by BJS for 1988 -- 2020 for use in elk DDHS manuscript (Smith et al. 2022; Ecol. Lett.)
  -- Data: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6687904

===============
Cougar Data
===============
Data compiled by BJS for 1987 -- 2020 for use in elk DDHS manuscript (Smith et al. 2022; Ecol. Lett.)
  -- Data: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6687904

Note that the cougar data are available as *density* rather than abundance (cougars/100 sq. km).
Cougar densities were estimated over slightly different areas in the 3 phases.
Convert to rough abundance by assuming 1800 sq km area (i.e., multiply by 18).
